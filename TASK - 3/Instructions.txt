//Instructions to Create a Python Program for Fibonacci Series.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Hereâ€™s how you can create a Python program to generate the Fibonacci series:

Initialize the First Two Numbers:

Start with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci series, a = 0 and b =1.
Decide the Length of the Series:

Define a variable to indicate how many numbers of the series you want to generate, for example, n = 10.
Use a Loop to Generate the Series:

Use a loop to calculate the next numbers in the series. In each iteration, the next number is the sum of the last two numbers.
Print or Store the Numbers:

Print the numbers or store them in a list to use later.
